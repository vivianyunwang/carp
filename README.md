Selfie app for self care 

**Description** 
A selfie app that allows you to take or upload your own selfies and then track key health metrics such as your mood, diet, and hours of sleep. 
The current iteration of the app allows you to journal and track your mood manually.
A following iteration will automate this process by implementing computer vision to determine these metrics through the selfies taken.
